# devops-homework1-task2

Steps for developing:

git checkout dev
git pull 
//for best experience make locally new branch from dev for your feature and after that merge into dev locally
//or just write your code in dev
git push origin dev // push your changes to dev
//after that make pull request into master from dev with comments what you did


For the best experience:

make pull request from your feature branch to dev
and we sometimes will make pull requests into master when we have a pack of changes in dev
